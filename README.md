  Built specifically for liquid-based industries, Vista bridges the gap between 
  raw chemical formulation and retail-ready inventory.

## 💎 Core Pillars

### ⚗️ Precision Formula Engine
Turn formulations into financial data. Vista doesn't just store recipes; it calculates the pulse of your product.
* **Dynamic Unit Costing**: Real-time cost-per-unit calculation ($) based on fluctuating raw ingredient market prices.
* **Margin Guard**: Live profitability projections during the R&D stage—know your margins before you blend.
* **Resource Mapping**: Granular tracking of ingredient concentration and SKU complexity.

### 🏭 Intelligent Production Hub
Bridge the gap between "The Batch" and "The Bottle."
* **Dual-Mode Execution**: Run production by **Unit Count** (bottles) or **Total Batch Weight** (kg/L).
* **Zero-Loss Sync**: Automated inventory depletion across raw ingredients and packaging upon run completion.
* **Pre-Flight Simulation**: Visual bottleneck alerts that identify stock shortages *before* you start a run.

### 📊 Financial Insights & Analytics
Executive-level visibility into your warehouse capital.
* **Inventory Valuation**: Instantly see the dollar value of your raw materials vs. finished goods.
* **Performance Tiers**: Identify high-margin "Hero SKUs" versus low-performance inventory.
* **Market Price Sync**: Global price updates that ripple through every formula in your system.
